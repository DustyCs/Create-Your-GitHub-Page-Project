# Create-Your-GitHub-Page-Project
Small kit to practice - Responsiveness, Jquery, JSON Practice and Fetch API

API used **Lorem Picsum**: https://picsum.photos/

## Directions

This repo contains files you could use to deploy github pages. Fork the Repo and **COMPLETE** the following:

1. The html and css side is incomplete and must become responsive on 3 screen sizes(Phone, Tablet, Computer) - (Media Queries)
2. Currently the images taken from Lorem Picsum is not working. **Fix it**. (Fetch API)
3. Typing your name in H1 might seem nice... But that's not enough. Input your details into data.json and get them to render on the main page using AJAX.
4. Congratulations! Now change the website as you wish any input you want and do as you will!

## **Now DEPLOY your website! with Github Pages!**

1. Change the name of the Repo into: (your github name).github.io
2. Go to settings
3. Within code and automation click Pages
4. Under Build and Deployment select Deploy from a Branch
5. Click branch and select the source you want to deploy!
6. Visit your site! at (your github name).github.io
